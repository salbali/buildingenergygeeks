{"name":"InverseBuilding","tagline":"Inverse problems in building physics","body":"### Welcome to the InverseBuilding page\r\n\r\nThis page is a series of tutorials showing how to solve various types of inverse problems, or model calibration problems, in Python. The physical application mostly revolves around heat transfer in building physics, hence the repo's name.\r\n\r\nIt is not a book on the theoretical fundations of inverse methods, but a set of cases aimed at giving clear and documented examples on how to implement some of them in Python. Each tutorial is an IPython notebook, and all the code is available in the page's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/srouchier/InverseBuilding).\r\n\r\nHere is the list of the courses available so far (or that will soon be)\r\n* [01_HeatConductivity](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/srouchier/InverseBuilding/blob/master/01_HeatConductivity/Notebook_HeatConductivity.ipynb): using Bayesian Inference and the [pymc](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/) package to estimate the thermal conductivity of a wall\r\n* [02_HeatFlow](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/srouchier/InverseBuilding/blob/master/02_HeatFlow/Notebook_HeatFlow.ipynb): linear and transient inverse heat conduction problem; calculating a heat flow from temperature measurements\r\n* 03_MoistureTransfer (coming soon): using an [evolutionary algorithm](http://deap.readthedocs.org/en/master/) for the characterisation of heat and moisture transfer properties of a material\r\n* 04_RC_Box (coming soon): using Bayesian Inference for the calibration of a very simple RC model of a building\r\n\r\n### Links\r\nThe courses in InverseBuildings use several useful Python packages\r\n* [pymc](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/): Bayesian statistical models\r\n* [deap](http://deap.readthedocs.org/en/master/): evolutionary algorithms\r\n* [pyfmi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyFMI/): loading and using Functional Mock-Up Units for co-simulation\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* Rouchier S., Woloszyn M., Kedowide Y., Bejat T.
