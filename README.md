# Building Energy Geeks (formerly InverseBuilding)

This repository hosts a series of tutorials on how to solve various types of data analysis problems in building physics.

* Energy performance assessment
* Prediction of energy use
* HVAC monitoring and fault detection
* Material characterisation

As of the last update of this description (March 24th 2020), the repository has just been renamed Building Energy Geeks, and a nice page is under construction to display all tutorials. Stay tuned !

You can still view the former version of the website [here](http://srouchier.github.io/InverseBuilding/).
