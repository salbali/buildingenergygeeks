summary: "A latent force model is a combination of parametric grey-box model and non-parametric Gaussian process model. It is a way to account for unmodeled disturbances which may have a high impact on the dynamics of the system."

The stochastic part of the state-space model can accomodate for unmodeled disturbances, which do not have a significant influence on the system dynamics. Otherwise, unmeasured disturbances can be modeled as temporal Gaussian Processes with certain parametrized covariance structure. The resulting **Latent Force Model** is a combination of parametric grey-box model and non-parametric Gaussian process model.
