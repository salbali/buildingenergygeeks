This category of the website is meant to host a series of tutorials on the basics of heat transfer in buildings.

Since the target of buildingenergygeeks is to bring building energy and data analysis together, one of the target audiences of this notebook are statisticians or data scientists who need a reference for the typical model structures that are used in building energy simulation.

As of the first upload of the website (April 2020), this category has not been started and only contains placeholder pages.
